Files:

.gitignore file --> only required and adapted files of the pybrn package are committed

Folder Python_Files:

CellCycleSynchronization_Preliminarities.py --> contains code of the preliminary simulations
		necessary for determination of limit cycle trajectory and cell division condition

CellCycleSynchronization_Simulation.py --> actual simulation of cell population with code for 
		calculation of input and simulation framework
